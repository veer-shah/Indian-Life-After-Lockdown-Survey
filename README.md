# Indian Post-Lockdown Survey

This was a project for Stanford's "MS&E 433: The Socio-economic Impact of the Novel Coronavirus on the Developing World" class in Spring 2020.

## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a situation in which decision makers must act on a few sources of information, and sometimes sources of information are noisy at best. Although lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and other efforts to contain the spread of the virus may have initially helped governments and researchers information gather, as these lockdowns ease -- as is the case in India -- decision makers have limited knowledge on what to expect from people in life after the lockdown.

Given Indiaâ€™s diverse population, surveying how people envision their life after lockdowns are lifted can give an insight into how the government can best respond to the evolving crisis. 

## Objective
Our goal is to understand the behavior of people after the lockdown is lifted. Since no such data existed at the time, we decided to implement a survey to gather this information. Our survey targets what types of economic activities people may engage in after the lockdown such as going to movie theaters, travelling and shopping, as well as how often they would partake in these activities. 

Since post-lockdown scenarios vary, we ask these questions under 2 scenarios:
1. A post-lockdown India similar to pre-COVID-19, and 
2. A post-lockdown India where social distancing and disinfecting is enforced. 

The survey also captures the family living situation of the individual, and demographic information like geography, gender, age, and employment.

By the end of the survey collection, we hope to provide researchers and policy-makers a new bank of data that captures the potential behavior of Indians after the lockdown. We hope that indicators of potential economic activity, as well as migration rates provided by the survey can be used in conjunction with epidemiological and other economic analyses that can better inform decision makers.
