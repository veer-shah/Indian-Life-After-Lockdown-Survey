# Indian Post-Lockdown Survey

This was a project for Stanford's "MS&E 433: The Socio-economic Impact of the Novel Coronavirus on the Developing World" class in Spring 2020.

In this project, our goal was to understand the behavior of people after the lockdown is lifted. Since no such data existed at the time, we decided to implement a survey to gather this information. Our survey targets what types of activities people may engage in after the lockdown (going to movie theaters, travelling and shopping), as well as how often they would partake in these activities. Since post-lockdown scenarios vary, we ask these questions under 2 scenarios -- 1. A post-lockdown India similar to pre-COVID-19, and 2. A post-lockdown India where social distancing and disinfecting is enforced. The survey also captures the family living situation of the individual, and demographic information like geography, gender, age, and employment. 

By the end of the survey collection, we hope to provide researchers and policy-makers a new bank of data that captures the potential behavior of Indians after the lockdown.

Sahaana Suri and Veer Shah worked on this project, under the counsel of Professor Ashish Goel and Professor Kamesh Mungala.
